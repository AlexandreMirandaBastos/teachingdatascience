# Teaching Data Science
This repository is a companion resource for the short course 'Teaching Data Science' by [MatrixDS](http://matrixds.com) The purpose of the course is to provide a meta framework and considerations when building ciriculum. There is a growing body of tutorial and courses about data science, machine learning, and artifical intelligence. However, many of these course are done without context or with tools that are difficult to apply after instruction. For example, consier Andrew Ng's [Machine Learning course on Corsera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning). This course is extremely popular and very well done. However, all of the instruction is done with Matlab / Octave; languages that do not enjoy signifigant popularity in the data science community.  

The following sections are references and resources for the course and attempt to help professors, instructors, and teachers build courses that have a lasting impact on their students.
